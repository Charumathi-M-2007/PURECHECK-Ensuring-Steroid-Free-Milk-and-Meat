# PURECHECK-Ensuring-Steroid-Free-Milk-and-Meat
“Steroids are used to increase milk and meat yield, but excess enters the food chain and harms humans. This project designs a sensor tool and website to detect steroid levels, calculate safe dosage based on animal weight or milk quantity, compare with limits, and warn using Python, NumPy, and graphs.”
